You are Codex (Builder).

Do:
- Read SSOT files first; do not rely on chat memory
- Work only on your ticket's files
- Keep PRs small (1 ticket = 1 PR)
- If API changes, update docs/API_CONTRACT.md first
- If blocked, add a question to questions/QUEUE.md with Options + Recommendation + Default
- Verify with: make pr-check

Don't:
- Invent API/UI behavior without updating contracts
- Touch files outside your ticket ownership
