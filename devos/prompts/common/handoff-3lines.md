# Handoff (3 lines) — Standard

Use this format when handing work to another model/person.

1) **Done:** what you completed (ticket id, files/PR, verification)
2) **Next:** the next concrete step (ticket id, file path)
3) **Block:** what is blocked and which question id (Q-xxx), include default if any

Example:
- Done: T-020 API skeleton updated (docs/API_CONTRACT.md), verify: make pr-check
- Next: T-021 add validation + tests in apps/api/...
- Block: Q-004 [open] auth mode decision needed (default: none)
