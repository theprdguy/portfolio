## Current Milestone
- Foundation / Operating System

  - SSOT files exist and are kept updated
  - make-based interface works (make kickoff / make triage / make pr-check)

## What works now (demo path)
- (TBD)

## In progress
- [ ] T-000 Bootstrap SSOT + Make + queues
- [ ] T-001 Define session-start triage routine

## Blockers / Questions

## Decisions (latest)
