# CONTEXT (TL;DR)

## What we are doing (1-2 lines)
- (TBD) We are bootstrapping a multi-LLM vibe-coding operating system.

## Operating mode
- SSOT-first, Contract-first, Ownership, Small PR, A-Mode questions
- Make is the standard interface: make pr-check is the minimum gate

## Current milestone
- Foundation: repo skeleton + queues + make interface working

## What works now (demo path)
- (TBD) Once a project exists, define the shortest demo flow here.

## Key decisions (top 5)
- Using Make for verification interface
- A-Mode: questions handled at session start in batches
- Contracts split into API_CONTRACT and UI_CONTRACT
- ADRs for decisions
- Ticket ownership to prevent conflicts

## Active tickets (top 10)
- See tasks/QUEUE.yaml

## Open questions (top 10)
- See questions/QUEUE.md (filter: [open])
